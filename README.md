# Employee Attrition Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict employee attrition using a dataset with over 30 attributes related to employee demographics, job roles, and performance metrics. The objective is to develop a predictive model to identify employees who are likely to leave the company. The project includes exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, model training, and deployment using Streamlit.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application to serve the model.
- `model.py`: Contains the code to train and evaluate the predictive model.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset files.
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies for the project.
- `README.md`: This file.

    Department: Department where the employee works
    DistanceFromHome: Distance of the employee's home from the workplace
    Education: Level of education of the employee
    EducationField: Field of education
    EmployeeNumber: Unique employee number
    EnvironmentSatisfaction: Satisfaction with the work environment
    Gender: Gender of the employee
    JobInvolvement: Level of job involvement
    JobRole: Role of the employee in the company
    JobSatisfaction: Level of job satisfaction
    MaritalStatus: Marital status of the employee
    MonthlyIncome: Monthly income of the employee
    NumCompaniesWorked: Number of companies the employee has worked for
    OverTime: Whether the employee works overtime (Yes/No)
    PercentSalaryHike: Percentage increase in salary
    PerformanceRating: Performance rating of the employee
    StockOptionLevel: Level of stock options
    TotalWorkingYears: Total number of years the employee has worked
    TrainingTimesLastYear: Number of training times last year
    YearsAtCompany: Number of years the employee has been with the company
    YearsInCurrentRole: Number of years the employee has been in the current role
    YearsSinceLastPromotion: Number of years since the last promotion
    YearsWithCurrManager: Number of years the employee has been with the current manager
    CommunicationSkill: Communication skill level

```
Data Preparation

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted to understand the dataset, identify patterns, and detect anomalies.
    Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.

Model Training

    Algorithms Used:
        Random Forest: A robust ensemble learning method for classification.
        4-Layer Neural Network: A deep learning model with multiple layers for improved prediction accuracy.
    Performance: Achieved an accuracy of 91% in predicting employee attrition probability.

Deployment

    Streamlit: Deployed the predictive model using Streamlit to create an interactive web application. Users can input employee attributes and receive attrition predictions.
